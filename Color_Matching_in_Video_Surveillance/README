- Developed an application to trace football players in the motion to analyze their physical condition by MATLAB
− Used Homography transformation to recognize the same football player in images taken by two cameras from different views
− Applied HSV color model, k-mean algorithm and Gaussian mixture model to complete object classification and clustering
− Compared the Mahalanobis distance of each color in Gaussian model and distinguish the correct result
